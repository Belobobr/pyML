MAchine Learning Algorithms from Professor Andrew Ng (Coursera, machine Learning online class) implemented in Python with numpy for vectorization

Algorithms :
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Back propagation

All algorithms currently use Gradient Descent as optimization routine.
All algorithms are regularized to avoid overfitting.
