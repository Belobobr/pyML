MAchine Learning Algorithms implemented in Python with numpy for vectorization

Supervised learning Algorithms :
1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Back propagation

All algorithms currently use Gradient Descent as optimization routine.
All algorithms are regularized to avoid overfitting.

Unsupervised learning:
4. Dynamic Time Warping
5. KMeans Clustering
6. Gaussian Mixture Model with Expectation Maximization algorithm
